## Project Description
------------------------------------------------
This project is written to decrypt tweets following the 4 steps specified in Assignment Documentation (https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/2015fa-cmpt-300-d1/pages/AssignmentOne/view).

"main" function is used to read encrypted file, call decrypt function and write decrypted tweets to the destination file.

"readline" function is called by main function. It is used to read encrypted file and return strings line by line. (standard c doesn't provide readline function) This function reads char by char from the given position of the file, appends the char to a string (initially empty), until it reaches a linebreak mark ('\n').

"decrypt" function is called by main function. It is used to execute the 4 descryption steps.

"fastpower" function is called by decrypt function. It is used to calculate (x^y)%m in a fast way. The algorithm is clearly descripted in wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation#Right-to-left_binary_method)


## Building and Running
------------------------------------------------
1. Please put memwatch.h in "include" folder, and memwatch.c in "src" folder;
2. Enter "src" folder and type "make clean", to make sure that previous building is cleaned up;
3. Execute command "make", to build the project;
4. The executable binary file (lyrebird) could be found in "bin" folder, and the temporary .obj files could be found in "build" folder;
5. Place the encrypted_tweets file at the same directory with the executable file (lyrebird), and run with the command: ./lyrebird [input file] [output file]
    e.g. ./lyrebird encrypted_tweets.txt decrypted_output.txt
